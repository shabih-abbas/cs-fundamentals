## 📚 Specialization Overview
The specialization consists of three intensive courses:

1. **Object-Oriented Data Structures in C++**
   - Setting up a development environment for writing and debugging C++ code
   - Classes, pointers, memory management
   - Implementation of data structures as C++ classes
     
2. **Ordered Data Structures**
   - Arrays, Linked Lists, Queues, Stacks
   - Trees (binary trees, BSTs, balanced trees)
   - Heaps and priority queues
   - Applications in searching and sorting with complexity analysis

3. **Unordered Data Structures and Algorithms**
   - Hash tables and disjoint sets
   - Graphs and graph algorithms
   - Shortest paths, spanning trees
   - Algorithmic complexity and tradeoffs
